# Cautro-C-
Welcome to the game of Cuatro.
The game of Cuatro is a two player game, where you try to complete a set      
of four pieces that are alike.  Players take turns making moves.    
On each move your OPPONENT chooses the piece, then YOU get to       
place it on the board.  If you create a set of four alike when      
you place your piece, then you win!       

A set of four alike can be completed by using four all upper (or all
lower) case characters, four all vowels (or all consonants), or four
all curved (or all straight-lined). Curved letters are 'O' and 'C'
(upper or lower), and straight-line letters are 'I' and 'Z' (upper or
lower). Groups of four can be created in a row, column, diagonal, or
corner quadrant.
